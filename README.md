<p>Did you honestly typed 1700+ lines of code containg only random objects by hand? </p>
<p>Well, I'll be honest. Yes I did (though I used a template), I started working on it <strong>immediately</strong> after I read just a litte about JS Objects, the idea instantly popped in my head and I just had to start working on it. Without knowing almost anything about OOP.</p>
<p>And it only took 2 working days so, despite It being a huge mistake, It still wasn't too big of a waste of time... i think.</p>
