My simple app to revise and not forget words in japanese

The day after learning about Objects in JS I was so excited to work with them, because the possibilities they guaranteed,
fit perfectly with my needs for a website!

The worst part is, back then I had no idea how databases worked, so everything that should have been extracted from a database from far away... is literally inside the .js files, so that's that.

After finishing what's left in Odin's Project for me, I will make an actuall, proper site, that would also involve users and more game-like ways of learning those words

- Not responsive
- No database
